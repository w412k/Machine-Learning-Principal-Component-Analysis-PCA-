# Machine Learning - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Tutorial

This repository contains the code and dataset for a tutorial on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in machine learning. The tutorial is based on the practice exercises provided by Codebasics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this tutorial is `heart.csv`, sourced from Kaggle. It is a comprehensive dataset containing various attributes related to heart health. The goal of this tutorial is to perform Principal Component Analysis on the dataset.

## Introduction to PCA

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. It allows us to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the most important information.

In this tutorial, we will explore the theory behind PCA and implement it using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn. By the end of the tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of PCA and its applications in machine learning.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
